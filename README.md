- Angular + NgMaterial
- Theme 
- Data API

## Basics
* [Python]()
  >(CW) reading free open source apis for machine learing. : one possible solution [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)  
  >(CW) So apparently, Tensorflow is run inside of configured environment with hardware/software requirements which may cost extra money and time, but instead there is online cloud dev environment developed by [Google Colabo](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb)
   * [9 Things about Tensorflow](https://hackernoon.com/9-things-you-should-know-about-tensorflow-9cf0a05e4995)
* [Dive into Machine Learning](https://github.com/hangtwenty/dive-into-machine-learning#readme)  
  >(JW) Machine Learning guide (w/ resources) for people with some Python knowledge.  


## Reads
* [Stock Prices Prediction Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/10/predicting-stock-price-machine-learningnd-deep-learning-techniques-python/)
  >(JW) This article was posted pretty recently (late October), and this can be our starting guide line. I haven't read it thoroughly yet; I will keep you guys posted if I find it irrelavant to our project.  
* [Stock Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4e59/7dfd9907e328c355a1c965fa6df51b07a932.pdf)  
  >(JW) Disregard this for now.
